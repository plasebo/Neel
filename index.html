              <p>Married to Cassee Gopal, the couple could not conceive a child in their initial marriage life.</p>
              <p>They thus laid their wish in the faith of <strong>Ganapati Bappa</strong> and made a promise that they

              <p>On <b>15/04/1894</b>, their first child, <b>Govind Bhiwajee</b> (commonly known as Jilloo) was born.
                From that year onwards the couple thus started <b>Ganapati celebrations</b> in their home at the foot of
                the 7 Cascades valley.</p>
              <p>Over the years, 2 new offsprings were added to the family namely, <b>Baban and Nanoo</b> and the family
                continued their faith in Bappa.
                Rituals like Bhoopali, Aarti, Lontangan and Visarjan were performed with the collaboration of family
                members, relatives and neighbours.</p>
              <p>During night time, to keep everyone entertained, they would sing and dance together around the famous
                jhakri in the praise of Bappa.</p>
              <p> Bhiwajee grew up as a strict and disciplined fellow and ensured that this vibrant family tradition is
                kept going. </p>

                They both mastered the art of singing and dancing jhakris not only within the family, but would go from
                village to village to perform along with their cousins and friends.</p>
              <p>Ganapati celebrations continued over the years at the residence of the family who had moved to the

            <p>In the 80’s <b>Guruji Sadanand Bhiwajee</b>, one among the eldest nephew of the family, gave a new
              dimension of this on-going family tradition.
              He started practicing puja vidhis as per Maharashtrian tradition which later became a standard for Ganesh
              Chaturthi Celebration in Mauritius.
              And since then, there has been no looking back. </p>
            <p>The Bhiwajee family still ardently and piously welcome Bappa every year in their midst, come what may.
              For the past two and a half decades now, Ganesh Chathurthi is being celebrated at the residence of <b>Mr.
                Rukmangat Bhiwajee</b> (commonly known by everyone as Babet) at Bhagat Lane, Glen Park. During the
              festivals, precious moments are shared within the family who ensures that no stone is left unturned to
              welcome both Bappa and His devotees in great pomp.</p>
              <p>With the blessings of the elders of the family, on numerous occasions, over the years, the divine idol was
              kept and adored by the family for more than <b>1½</b> days.</p>
            <p>Moreso, the Bhiwajee family’s Ganapati can boast of its pure silver jewellery with which it is adored
              every year.</p>
            <p>And this year, we, the Bhiwajee family will proudly celebrate the <b>125th</b> consecutive year of welcoming
              Bappa among us at home. For us, He is not just a Murti we bring home and offer our prayers but is
              considered as our very special guest visiting the family and fulﬁ lling all our wishes, as Sukh Kartaa and
              Doukh Haarta (spreading Happiness and eliminating sorrows).
